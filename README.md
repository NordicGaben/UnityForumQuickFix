# Unity Forum Quick Fix
Replace "$$anonymous$$" back to "hi" on all url's starting with 'https://answers.unity.com/' by installing this **chrome** extension.

You might have encountered the rather cryptic '$$anonymous$$' in the middle of a unity forum post, and I have to say it's a little annoying. 
I've seen many mention this and some have even submitted tickets asking for this to be fixed and others run javascript code each time to fix this

So I asked ChatGPT to make a chrome extension to fix this problem as learning javascript is still on todo list, I decided to put this here in case someone else wants to use it.

## Installation:

You can clone this repository or directly copy the code from the file, then you navigate to "chrome://extensions/" and enable developer mode in the top right corner

then click "load unpacked" and select the folder with the downloaded files. After that you are good to go and safe to read the unity forums (to the best of my knowledge)

## Note!
This only fixes the instances where there was supposed to be a 'hi', this seems the most recent form of the break but it used to be a problem that 'M' was replaced with '$$anonymou$$'. I'm unsure if that is still a problem but this works for me for now.
